excerpt: Data scientist with strong theoretical background.

### Current Employment
I am currently employed as a data scientist at Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. in Columbus, Ohio. I'm working on a team working towards implementing a model monitoring system to capture prediction drift in producution models. 

### Educational Background

I received a Master of Science in Statistics degree in December of 2021 from The Ohio State University. I completed my undergraduate degree in Mathematics with minors in Statistics and Actuarial Science at Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania in May of 2019.

### Work Experience

I have worked as an actuarial intern at Highmark Health within the Revenue Program Management department on the analytics team. My main focus while there was improving upon a risk score calculation model for Medicare Advantage members. The new model is used to analyze and forecast trends related to emerging technology within the healthcare field. I also assisted in developing and building new data tables to support risk score models. 

Currently, I am a graduate teaching associate at The Ohio State University in the Department of Statistics. I am lecturing for an undergraduate statistics course that is a calculus-based introduction to statistical inference for students majoring in biology or other life science fields which enrolls roughly 110 students per section. I have also led recitations for introductory-level statistics courses and been a grader for graduate level statistics and data analytics courses. 

### Research Experience

I have always been interested in the field of statistical learning, even prior to deciding to pursue statistics at a graduate level. During my undergraduate degree, a main focus of mine was sports analytics. More specifically, taking methodologies such as Markov chain simulation and modern statistical learning methods and using them to model different problems within the sport industry. I was fortunate enough to be able to present my research at multiple international conferences. 

Although coursework and teaching duties consumed most of my time at Ohio State, I was still able to find time to focus on my areas of interest. I was involved in areas such as Bayesian model averaging, implementing a Bayesian CART model search, and research pertaining to Support Vector Machines. I have realized that although I enjoy statistics and using new and modern techniques, I am not as interested in pursuing theoretical research in statistics.

I have included more information about selected projects on the portfolio page of this website. Selected projects are also viewable on my GitHub.
