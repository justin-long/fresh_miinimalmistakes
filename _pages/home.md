### Educational Background

I'm a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at The Ohio State University, and I will be leaving the department at the end of this spring semester. I received a Master of Science in Statistics degree in December of 2021 from The Ohio State University. I completed my undergraduate degree in Mathematics with minors in Statistics and Actuarial Science at Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania in May of 2019.

### Work Experience

I am a graduate teaching associate at The Ohio State University in the Department of Statistics. I am currently lecturing for an undergraduate statistics course that is a calculus-based introduction to statistical inference for students majoring in biology or other life science fields which enrolls roughly 110 students per section. I have also led recitations for introductory-level statistics courses and been a grader for graduate level statistics and data analytics courses. 

### Research Experience

I have always been interested in the field of statistical learning, even prior to deciding to pursue statistics at a graduate level. During my undergraduate degree, a main focus of mine was sports analytics. More specifically, taking methodologies such as Markov chain simulation and modern statistical learning methods and using them to model different problems within the sport industry. I was fortunate enough to be able to present my research at multiple international conferences. 

Although coursework and teaching duties consumed most of my time at Ohio State, I was still able to find time to focus on my areas of interest. I was involved in areas such as Bayesian model averaging, implementing a Bayesian CART model search, and research pertaining to Support Vector Machines. I have realized that although I enjoy statistics and using new and modern techniques, I am not as interested in pursuing theoretical research in statistics.

I have included more information about selected projects on the portfolio page of this website. Selected projects are also viewable on my GitHub.
